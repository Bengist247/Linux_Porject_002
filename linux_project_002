🔶 FOCUS: Linux System Administration Basic Commands
 "mkdir, rm, pwd, rm -r, ls /, ls -l, cd, cd ../, touch, nano, echo, cp, mv, cat, tail, head, *, 

Hi Friends,
As promised, to drop more hands-on practice Linux projects, my teammate Chinenye Obodo and I collaborated again to work on another real-world scenario project, to help us get acquainted and hone our skills with hashtag#Linux Basic Commands.
 
Here is a breakdown of all the commands used in the project and their usefulness

✴️ Directory Management
✔️ mkdir -- Create a new directory.
✔️ cd -- Change the current working directory
✔️ cd ../ -- Move one level up in the directory structure.
✔️ pwd -- Print the current working directory.
✔️ ls / -- List files and directories in the root directory 
✔️ ls -l -- List files and directories in long format, shows permissions, size, etc.

✴️ File/Directory Deletion
✔️ rm -- Remove a file.
✔️ rm -r -- Recursively remove a directory and its contents.
✔️ rmdir -- Remove an empty directory only.

✴️ File Creation and Editing
✔️ touch - Create an empty file.
✔️ nano - Used to write and edit content
✔️ echo - Print a message or write text to a file. 

✴️ File and Directory Operations
✔️ cp - Copy files or directories. 
✔️ mv -- Move or rename files or directories.

✴️ Viewing File Content
✔️ cat -- Concatenate and display file content.
✔️ head -- Display the first few lines of a file .
✔️ tail -- Display the last few lines of a file.

✴️ Objectives
👉 Establish a standardized and logical directory hierarchy on the Linux servers to improve project file organization and accessibility for development teams.

👉 Efficiently migrate existing project files into the new directory structure, minimizing disruption to ongoing development workflows.

👉 Create new organizational files and directories as needed to support better project management and collaboration.

👉 Ensure a consistent file system structure across different development teams to streamline navigation and resource sharing.

👉 Optimize file access and management to enhance the overall efficiency of the development process on the Linux infrastructure.
